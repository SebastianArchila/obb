# Technisches Assessment ‚Äì Data Engineer / ETL

## Overview üöÜ

This repository contains the resources and scripts for the Data Engineer / ETL technical assessment. The project involves data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes, as well as data validation and analysis tasks.

## Project Structure üìë

- **data/**: Directory containing the input CSV file and output CSV files such as cleaned data, final data for SQL, and data quality validation errors
- **logo/**: Directory containing images
- **.gitignore**: File specifying which files and directories to ignore in the repository
- **database.db**: SQLite database file
- **main.ipynb**: Main Jupyter Notebook script
- **requirements.txt**: File listing project dependencies

## Setup Instructions üíª

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   cd your-repo
   git clone https://github.com/RomeoSe/obb.git
2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   - Ensure Python 3.12 (recommended) is installed
   - Create a virtual environment
        ```sh
        py -m venv venv
    - Activate the virtual environment:
        ```sh
        venv\Scripts\activate
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
## To Consider ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Assumptions

* It was assumed that the column "Fahrtnummer" is the same as "Zug id"

### Conclusions

* **Zug id**: Instead of deleting rows with missing values in, values were imputed. Three rows still have missing values; however, those are repeated rows. Therefore, only these three rows have been deleted. 

* **Zug id**: Instead of deleting rows with alphabetic characters in the Zug id, the values were corrected. However, three rows still contained alphabetic characters; since those entries are duplicates, they were deleted. 

* **Messung**: Due to not knowing exactly what "Messung" refers to, the rows with missing values were dropped. 

* **Messung**: Negative numbers were converted to positive only if they were surrounded by the same 'Zug id'. The remaining negative values (approximately 5) were deleted. 

* **Average speed**: There are speeds that are practically impossible. It's a topic for discussion due to possible errors in the data. 

* **General**: After data preprocessing and cleaning, to avoid future conflicts, the last 5 rows were deleted as they only differed in the 'Messung' value compared to the other columns (all other values were duplicates, taking Zug id as reference). 

* **General**: The column "Abfahrtsdatum" was not entirely clear to me. What does it really define compared to Abfahrtszeit?
